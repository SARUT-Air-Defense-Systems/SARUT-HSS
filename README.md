# SARUT Air Defense System

## Overview
SARUT is a multidisciplinary air defense systems project developed for TEKNOFEST.
The system integrates computer vision, artificial intelligence, embedded control,
and simulation to detect, classify, and respond to aerial targets autonomously.

---

## System Architecture

The project is divided into four core subsystems:

### 1. Image Processing
Handles camera input, preprocessing, object detection, and tracking.

Location:
src/image_processing/

---

### 2. Artificial Intelligence
Implements classification models, decision-making logic, and tracking optimization.

Location:
src/ai/

---

### 3. Embedded Systems
Contains firmware, motor control, sensor integration, and hardware communication.

Location:
src/embedded/

---

### 4. Simulations
Includes simulation environments for algorithm testing before deployment.

Location:
src/simulations/

---

## Development Strategy
Each subsystem is developed independently using feature branches
and integrated into the main branch via pull requests.
